                <p>Your Boomerang for Gmail plan will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your account,
                    downgrade your plan, cancel recurring billing, or we terminate your account. You must cancel your
                    account or downgrade your plan before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the
                    next month's or year's fees to your credit card. Baydin will bill the monthly or yearly fees
                    associated with your service plan, plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us
                    during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your account information).</p>
                <p>Paid Boomerang for Gmail plans are prepaid and are non-refundable. BAYDIN DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR
                    CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL MONTHS OR YEARS. You may cancel or downgrade your account at any time, and
                    the cancellation or downgrade will take effect at the end of the billing cycle. If you wish to
                    cancel your account or change your plan, you may do so via the Manage your Account link in the
                    Boomerang menu inside your Gmail account, or from the link we sent you when you upgraded your
                    account. Should you elect to cancel or downgrade your account, please note that you will not be
                    issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly fees.</p>
                <p>By upgrading to a paid Boomerang for Gmail plan and providing Baydin with your payment account
                    information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.</p>
